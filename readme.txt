jQuery auto completion with the auto-complete library by Corey Hart's (http://plugins.jquery.com/project/auto-complete).

This is just a stub, I'll write up the basic details later. Just take a look at jac_example if you want to get a basic idea of how you can use this app.

Caveat Emptor (buyer beware!), this is mostly just a proof of concept, that I may or may not decide to develop in the future! There are no tests (yet), so use it at your own risk.
